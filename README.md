Changes added by me: 

Add the least squares support vector machines multi label classifier.
How to use is specified on the example on /examples/

# LSSVMlib
Library of python classes for performing Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) 
machine-learning modeling. The classes are build to conform to the scikit-learn API allowing for 
smooth integration with scikit-learn based projects.
